# Image-Classifier-Project
#we want to include an image classifier in a smart phone app. To do this, we'd use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of flowers images
#first we load and preprocess the image dataset
#then we download the pre-trained network, weights and parameter then load it into our model 
#after that we Freeze our features parameters and change model.classifier
#then we Train the image classifier on our image dataset
#finally we use the trained classifier to predict image content
